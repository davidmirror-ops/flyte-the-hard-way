## Connecting to Flyte through Ingress

1. From the **AWS Management Console** go to **Route 53**
2. Click on the hosted zone where you plan to create the DNS record
3. Click on **Create record**
4. Under **Record name** enter the domain name you used to request your certificate (`flyte-the-hard-way.uniondemo.run` in this tutorial)
5. From the **Record type** menu, select **CNAME**. This record type will allow you to redirect every request to the Ingress FQDN
6. From the command line, obtain the Ingress FQDN:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n flyte
```

Example output:

```bash
NAME                              CLASS    HOSTS                              ADDRESS                                                      PORTS   AGE
flyte-backend-flyte-binary-grpc   <none>   flyte-the-hard-way.uniondemo.run   k8s-flyte-7fbf3d130b-550555649.<AWS_REGION>.elb.amazonaws.com   80      3h8m
flyte-backend-flyte-binary-http   <none>   flyte-the-hard-way.uniondemo.run   k8s-flyte-7fbf3d130b-550555649.<AWS_REGION>.elb.amazonaws.com   80      3h8m
```

The FQDN corresponds to the `ADDRESS` value in the previous output.

7. Back at the **Route 53** GUI, paste the `ADDRESS` into the `Value` field
8. Click on **Create records**

**NOTE**: typically, DNS propagation takes about 60 seconds for Route 53 hosted zones. You can check status by selecting your DNS record and clicking on **View status**. It should be `INSYNC`.

9. Back at your terminal, find and edit you `$HOME/.flyte/config.yaml` file to reflect the following:

```yaml
admin:
  # For GRPC endpoints you might want to use dns:///flyte.myexample.com
  endpoint: dns:///flyte-the-hard-way.uniondemo.run #Replace with your domain name
  authType: Pkce
  insecure: false
  insecureSkipVerify: true
logger:
  show-source: true
  level: 6
```

10. Run your first workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks
cd flytesnacks/cookbook
pyflyte run --remote core/flyte_basics/hello_world.py my_wf
```

Example output:

```bash
Go to https://flyte-the-hard-way.uniondemo.run/console/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/executions/f7b562cecd41a44b4a17 to see execution in the console.
```

11. Paste the URL from the previous output in your browser:

## Closing remarks

**Congratulations!**

You have completed the process to deploy and configure a Flyte instance using Ingress networking and SSL. In the next section, we'll see how to configure authentication and authorization to improve the security posture of your deployment.
